    "- **Temporal limitations**: The scraped data represents a snapshot of the market at a specific time, potentially missing seasonal trends or long-term market evolution.\n",
    "- **Geographic coverage**: While we focus on major Swiss cities, some smaller municipalities or suburban areas might be underrepresented in the dataset.\n",

We used an alpha of 100 to apply strong regularization, which helps prevent overfitting and ensures better generalization. This is particularly useful when working with many features, including categorical variables like City, as it reduces multicollinearity and stabilizes the coefficients.\n",

    "Throughout this project, we gained valuable insights into web scraping, especially how to extract data from dynamic pages and handle different HTML structures, such as span elements, lists, and dictionaries. This was crucial in ensuring that we could gather and structure the necessary data effectively. Additionally, we developed a strong understanding of the entire data pipeline, from data collection and cleaning to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and finally, building and evaluating a predictive model for rental prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we also encountered some limitations, particularly the lack of a structured way to share code at the beginning. Without a reliable version control system like GitHub, collaboration was more difficult, and managing changes in the codebase was challenging. This experience highlighted the importance of using tools like GitHub, which we plan to integrate into future projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking ahead, there are several ways to improve our model. One major area is incorporating macroeconomic factors like interest rates, inflation, or employment rates, which can significantly influence rental prices. Additionally, increasing the size and diversity of the dataset by collecting more observations would likely enhance model accuracy. Further experimentation with feature engineering and different modeling techniques could also help refine predictions and better capture real-world pricing trends. Moreover, we also tried to make a sentiment analysis based on the property descriptions and what impact it has on price, however, we decided against doing it as it would go beyond the scope of this project\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project was a great learning experience and a lot of fun, but it also required hard work to get everything running as we had originally envisioned. From setting up the web scraper to handling dynamic pages and extracting structured data, to processing and analyzing the data before finally building our predictive model, every step came with its own challenges. However, overcoming these obstacles made the final results even more rewarding."
